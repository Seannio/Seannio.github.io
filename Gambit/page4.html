      <h2>Animal Path</h2>
      <p>Apparently some of you thought that my game was not clever enough to start from an angel talking to you. This is fine. This is totally fine. I accept that sometimes to make art, you have to be challenged, so fine, I’ll give you two options. Instead of exploring the Hero’s journey, you can chose to be a panda, or Steve the penguin. 
But because I had such a fun design in mind before, this choice won’t be without its consequences. One path will lead you to a tory line I had discarded before I set out to do this, so with enough tweaks you and I can make it fun together. <br><br>
The other will lead you down a sad little story to show you how insignificant and sad I think you are. <br><br>
Chose wisely. <br><br>
