      <h2>Nothing Duller than Paradise</h2>
      <p>"That's Right" The Angel begins. "Most People come to realize that a life fileld with every desire is about the worst fate you could have. There is nothing to drive a person in a life filled with every delight imaginable. Imagine everything you've ever wanted without the delight of having earned it. That's what The Creator failed to see when he offered humans endless salvation and paradise. Humans have been most miserable there, losing all motivtion, most of them chose to turn off their senses and live in a dull heap of glowing light. Others chose to condemn themselves to Hell just to feel any sense of Purpose again. The sad reality is that the largest amount of sinners come to us out of Heaven. There's not a good soul left in the universe that would not rather burn in hell than be bored in heaven. That's why I'm here. I want you to show me the worst miseries that humans endure. Only then can my life take on any meaning at all. I must understand, please." </p>

      <p> Nothing in her words made any sense to you. Why would an Angel want to suffer with humans? <p>
