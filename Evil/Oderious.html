      <h2>Oderious</h2>
      <p>Nobody in town knows how he came around. It was likely in the night, and definitely about six months ago you recall. Oderious was, from the moment his purple snake-skinned shoes hit the perimeter of your lazy village, a sensation. It wasn’t just that nobody knew where he came from, nobody even knew where he lived, but he made his presence felt. Everywhere that Oderious needed something done, he would send out a mute servant. Strange as it was, the sight of the servant was enough for merchants to nonetheless always know what was expected of them. A mute with a commanding voice on sight. Add to the legend that Oderious never bid twice and you have a picture of power. He could snap the fingers on his domineering hands, and what he wished was his. That snap, a miniscule break in an otherwise silent room commanded the bodies of whatever poor souls were determined next to act. His physique also added to his total domination of those around him. His skin was deceitful, at once pale, and faded green, his body constantly alluded to a snake, that is, if you didn’t mistake him for a patient stumbling out of a morgue. His cheeks, severely raised accentuated his flat nose, and bald head. To cover the grotesqueness of his whole face, at some point through his years, Oderious had covered his face in an oblique tattoo of a honeycomb. The implication was there, if you look at his jagged neck, that, the tattoo continued, possibly throughout his whole body, but the proof of the implication was hidden behind his tight fitting, dark purple suit. This fit from the near-asphyxiating base of his neck all the way down his tall, lanky frame, to sit, elegantly at the bottom of his legs. Every so often, the mystique would be broken, as the tavern he frequents every Friday night would be filled with the scummiest bastards trying to win his attention. This filling, this over—burdening of the small establishment, would cause the heat per square inch ration to be too much and Oderious would take off his jacket, stretch it on the tip of his finger, and it wouldn’t linger there for a second before his servant would whisk it from him and hold it for the remainder of his business dealings. This would, incidentally, reveal the thickness of his veins, without which, the rest of his body would surely deflate. The servant would stand solemnly holding that jacket, unblinking, awaiting for Oderious to be done examining all who had come to ask him for employment. Sometimes people asked Oderious directly what the deal was with his servant, how such a person could actually sustain himself upright, in silence, and in attendance, but Oderious would shoot them a look through his thin, piercing eyes, and they knew better than to ask again. He did however have his humanity about him, as much as you can call him human. It was rumored in the town that at a certain point in the night it would get too warm for Oderious, even with his jacket off, and a single bead of sweat would traverse his honeycombed forehead, and, as he lacked any eyebrows, would crest straight into his upper lip where it would disappear into his smiling, sharp teeth. At that point, and only at that point, Oderious would declare that he had enough petitions and him and his servant would part the crowd with a wave of his hand. In the darkness of the night, all that the patrons could see was the emerald ring on Oderious’s left hand glowing green. This was a man whose attention would go a long way into your goal of spiting Fate. So adventurer, how would you like to get that attention?  </p>
