      <h2>The Gloomy Pub at the Outskirts of Town</h2>
      <p>It takes you a while to traverse to the pub. Finding the Pub itself was not hard; it is the only structure left standing in the District of Paupile. This was the town’s attempt at expanding its territory during your father’s lifetime, but by the time you were born, there was nothing left in this district except for the Pub, and there was not much left of that either. The path there was a blur. After leaving the last of the town's actualy districts, the district of Plenusile, the noise of the city quiets down. The warmth glow of its lights heat only your backside. Its odd though, because although the official government position is that this district has been abandoned, there are still plenty of people crawling about here. Staying on the path, which is also surprisingly intact, you could see that there were pitched tents all around. Whole families squatting on the barren plane, a testament to the fact that when this district collapsed, some people could not manage to reintegrate themselves back into the rest of the hustle and bustle of the town. It is as if their wills died too, and their bodies, despite the fact that they had nothing else, demanded that they take a pause from it all. The consequences were dire. Likely, none of these people would survive the winter, yet, they remain motionless because at some point there is a limit to the abilities of all of us. This assessment of the surroundings made the already darkened path feel gloomy. If you were to step off it, maybe your hope for life too would collapse, and you’d be left banished not for your crimes, but for your misfortune. So you kept on. It wasn’t long to the pub, and after that there stretched out a whole lot of nothing. It was safe to assume that if you kept on going forward you would eventually reach another town, or at least some sort of settlement, but you know nobody that has returned from those trips. You get there unbothered by anything but your thoughts. The pub itself is deceptively small. Inside, through a dusty window, you can see that the place is packed. Thank goodness its Friday otherwise it might just have been you and the burly barkeep. Bowers, as he was called, had rebuilt this place after the previous pub burned down. That was during the good times, and as such, people saw it as a solvable tragedy. For a while it remained a burned husk of a place reminding people of the fire. To some this signaled a stall in the prosperity of the district as a whole. As the old saying by the infamous Jasper goes “If you’re not building, you’re dying”. A simple saying, but it started trending around town until Bowers decided to pick that place up and reconstruct. Another Pub in the ashes of the former. He decided to call it the Phoenix’s Ash. A dashy title that for a while had people coming and going, and Bowers a very popular man. In a way, it was probably that sense of early success that kept Bowers here long after everything had abandoned the district. No other buildings remained. The town had always been very good at depopulating a location. If it were not for the path and this Pub now standing in front of you, there would be nothing to tell you that anything happened here at all. Why else might Bowers have remained? As they were leaving, some said that Bowers was an optimist. He has raised something from nothing, and even if everything around him disappeared, he would persevere. That is what they said at the end. Bowers himself betrayed that sentiment. When the end was more obvious than people wanted to admit he started getting the shakes. His anxiety had turned him into being quite curt with people. A man that once invited people to have a lively time was shut in, even as the last people of the district took refuge in his bar top. He became neglectful, and it was obvious now as you continued to peer through the window that the dust had encrusted itself there for a long time. Bowers once was a man of some popular repute who held on to the secrets and stories of others, and who could be counted on for a night of revelry. Yet today, the man that was left clearing the beer mugs didn’t care for anything else except a quiet night of drinking. He had made enough money while the times were good that he could remain undisturbed in his steady rhythm. A drink, a night, a night, a drink. That was the plan until forever. You step under the sign that is so worn it reads closer to “Phoeni…A…” than anything else. The chains surprise you only because something so rusty should not be able to hold up and yet, there it was. The red rust contrasted well with the shambled wooden paneling that was once a different, brighter, shade of brown. You open the door and you can’t help but be disappointed. What you had assumed was going to be the waft of hops and barley was instead like walking into a Gymnasium. The amount of sweat that had been poured in here made the humidity insufferable. There were far too many people in this faceless mass for the size of the room, and your nose was the main loser of this overflow. You could make out Bowers, working his own way through a large mug of red ale, and everyone else was engaged with the corner booth at the end of the pub. Their backs were turned to you as they were all listening to whatever Oderious was saying. You were to far away to make out anything but his voice. At the edge of the crowd you saw a form whom you quickly identified as Oderious’s servant, holding his jacket at attention, waiting for his next command. The only other thing worth noting was that in the crowd you could make out something like a cat with a little hat on his head. No idea what that might be about though. Bowers pays you no mind as you stand there examining the room. You become so warm that you’re surprised this whole place has not caught on fire. That warmth reminds you that you are here on a mission adventurer, so what do you do next?  </p>
