      <h2>You Turn to face the Angel</h2>
      <p>A shadow has fallen onto your face. Already, with this choice, you understand that there are malificent forces brewing inside of you brewing to bring forth your destiny. However, when you turn around you realize that the Angel is gone. This is strange...you could have sworn she was standing right there..</p>
      <p>Not much makes sense anymore. The shadow on your face seems to have grown powerful because you can no longer see where you were. Physically, nothing feels right. The former ground you were standing on has vanished. Its all shadow now. <p>
