      <h2>Evil Lord Bondage</h2>
      <p>Yes, you breathe slowly, letting the idea consume you. An Established evil lord will be the perfect starting point for someone like you. There, you will be introduced to the worst bile that the city has to offer. This thought pleases you. First, you will join a lord and bind yourself to him eternally. Then, slowly, he shall reveal that you alone had more power inside than he could ever handle. </p>
