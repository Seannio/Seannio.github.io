      <h2>The Cat</h2>
      <p> You finally come into your senses and move to get a better view of the crowd. As you pass by, the only signs of life that Bowers offers is a slight nudge upwards of his brows. You’re not interested in him, and he is barely interested in you. What you are interested in though is that cat with the small hat on his head. You position yourself closer to the crowd so you can see that it is a rather small cat. Its orange fur seems to be making a wave-like pattern and Oderious’s fingers stroke it like ships lost in a storm. There is a fury to that interaction. Oderious doesn’t pay you any mind, and although he has the entire room captivated in his next nefarious scheme, you fail to pay attention to it because your eyes are lost in that storm of fur. It calls to you. Without much thought then, you part the crowd and step into what is normally a space reserved for petitioning Oderious. The murmurs you were already ignoring die out completely as everyone’s eyes turn to you. Most of the people there are hoping you are going to make some sort of blunder now, so that they can sweep in and woo Oderious afterwards. You surprise everyone however, by continuing on, transfixed on the fur that will not relent its fever grasp on your gaze. As you climb onto the table in the booth, Oderious takes notice of you. Nobody cuts him off, and nobody tries to one up him, and yet here you are, the baboon reaching for his fuzzy orange banana. When you get close enough to the cat that your aim to grab it is clear, Oderious stops speaking. His face doesn’t read anything other than amused, and his eyes slither over to the same side of his now-cresting mouth. He sits waiting to see if you actually have the guts to take his cat. Your hands are nearly at him now and your nose, which is always on point can smell the salivation coming from Oderious. He’s hungry for your action. Your heart mimics the thunderous rage of thunder, and your arms the speed of lightning. You’re a blur to all as you snatch the cat and turn to run. Oderious, already ahead of you, purses his lips and bites out with his sharpened teeth, tearing off a chunk of your triceps. The blood makes the whole place reek of metal. Your eyes close with the pain as you tumble sideways off the table, but onto the floor where dozens of dark faces stare at you like vultures. This is their moment. The King has allowed carrion on the menu tonight. Some bother to pull out weapons before they pounce but others just start ripping into you. Your shoes, your pants, your shirt and then your skin and limbs. There is no fighting anyone off, and nobody is coming to save you. Your body isn’t helpful anymore because its being lacerated faster than it can react. The last movement you can voluntarily make is to open your eyes one last time before they are plucked out of your skull. They stare straight ahead into the face of the cat and its own eyes stare back at you. Behind it you can see one of the more muscular fellows has managed to rip out your guts and he is holding them in one hand like Perseus Triumphant. Then the very last thought you have as your life gives out in between the hoots and the cheers for your death is that when you snatched it up, the cat lost his little hat. He really isn’t that cute anymore.   </p>
