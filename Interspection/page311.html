      <h2>Existential Crisis</h2>
      <p>Wait…Why do you stay there? If the supposedly most blessed place in the universe is still cursed to the point where people would rather suffer what is your purpose? You are merely perpetuating a system where worship is sold off as salvation but its really the prolongation of suffering. You want dulled out spirits? Devoid of any passion or camaraderie? Just fully pleased individuals ?? Like congratulations everyone has everything they’ve ever wanted???? This is some Soma taking shit straight from Brave new world. And you! Why did you even come here? You proclaim me a hero as if that is what I want? Sure I have aspirations, but most of them have gone away since I was born with red hair. Do you know what it is like to be a man with red hair? Ridicule, hatred, nobody will touch me, but I’ve accepted that. This life isn’t one of pleasure, but it is still worthwhile despite my cripplingly colored hair because of the effort it takes to merely be me. And you want to take me to pleasure eternally? Or to be some sort of savior for others to give my life meaning? You are nothing but a malicious actor of the devil, of evil. From the day my bangs tumbled over my eyes I knew God had forsaken me. So why are you even here? Everyone you help ends up as a husk of a person, no thank you, I’ll take my shitty existence. <br><br><br><br>

You’re panting at the end of this rant, no clue as to where this deep passion against heaven came from. The angel is staring at you, and for a second you see a sly smile come across her face. <br><br>

“what if instead of becoming a hero, I offer you something else? I’ll take your troubles away once and for all. I’ll change your natural hair color to any of your choosing. Just say the word and it is yours.”
A tremor starts in your legs and crawls all the way up your spine to your fiery crown. This would mean ultimate salvation, no more red… you would finally have a chance at a soul. <br><br>
