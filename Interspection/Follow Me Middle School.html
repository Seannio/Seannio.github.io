      <h2>Middle School</h2>
      <p>“Let me explain to you something”, you continue as you make your way down the slope. “You think you have it good up there because you don’t feel desire? You have no idea what it is like to feel desire and have it never be fulfilled. The opposite of what you have is not a guarantee of something less horrible. And it’s no the old adage of the grass being greener. Sometimes all alternatives just suck. You, right now,  have the privilege to be fulfilled, but I’m going to take you to a place where that is never the case. This is a place where all wishes get strangled in their inception, and before you have a chance to believe in being a top chef, you’re forty, balding, and divorced.” <br><br>
You’ve now descended the hill and rightfully so, because it was getting scorching hot up there for the middle of the day. The Angel is listening to you as you enter into town. This was a perfect day to show the angel around too. Not even the meteorologist could complain about the weather. It is the type of sunny days that clouds are afraid of. On your walk through town you even bump into a dog. The little guy panted and wagged his fluffy tail. The angel pet him first, and found it pleasant. She looked up at you with a beaming face. You lead her to the core of your neighborhood and stopped in front of a large building that you knew all too well.<br><br>
“You said you wanted to see real human suffering?” You say as the door swings open. “Welcome to my Middle School.” 
The Angel was curious and so continued to follow you. She had an admiration for every thing around her, as though it was being perceived for the first time. Surely this couldn’t be right, because angels are divine beings. They have lived longer than you right? Maybe…Or maybe it was the case that to beings who are born with total access to pleasure have never seen imperfect things. Imperfection lights the flame of curiosity. God, you think to yourself, you haven’t felt that burning feeling of being made into a curiosity for some time. When that feeling comes, you know that you and your surroundings aren’t valued for what they are, no, they are valued for how far away they are from the acceptable. Behind her eyes of admiration is a world completely disassociated with what she was seeing. A world she did not understand how to appreciate. So your anxiety took hold of your jaw. Your teeth and tongue conspired to hide your embarrassment behind a wall of sound that only acted to calm yourself down. The words did not convince her of anything, yet she would be the only one to remember them because none of it was registering to you. This was anxiety’s domain and you were a mere vessel.  <br><br>
That feeling stuck to you as you show the angel around. Sadly, it also intensified. Pointing to all your old memories and relationships to this building that once contained everything you hate about yourself made those feelings return. Its was hard to feel like in a place where nobody liked you, this angel could go around and participate in merriment. How could she be so gleeful where once you were mocked? <br><br>
You take a moment to catch your breath and continue to point at things and recount to her anecdotes. She marches on beside you with her head twisting and eyeing whatever thing she finds most amusing in that moment. While you speak you also remind yourself that, while this place is bad, surely you did not have it the worst. <br><br>
When you first read it in Lenin you had scarcely believed it. Yet as the old saying goes, in middle school, as with everything, the poorer people always suffer harder. This wasn’t as evident to you at the time. All those years ago, you were just a mass of budding hormones trying to bounce around with your fellow classmates. Some moments were rude awakenings, sure. There was that time you had been heading back to your locker from just having said goodbye to your best friend Sophie when you received a text from a random peer telling you to kill yourself. Those words ran up your spine and your whole body shook. The color from your face drained as much as the memory of whatever it was you and Sophie had just talked about. This was more important. Why did someone want me to die? You remember scanning that message over and over again for some meaning. This was a time where every interaction felt loaded with significance and direction. Such messages were clearly a sign of a life that was hurled to its doom. Scanning that text, you read over all of the points on it and this person had detailed every reason they wanted you dead. You were a bitch. You were too skinny. You had eyes that were too big and so you looked different. And so on so forth! There were a whole eight things that she hated about you. It was only later that you would see a pattern. Anonymous messages from people that were too scared to confront you directly. And as you grew you knew that they were going through difficult situations. While your parents sat you in front of a piano so that you could play a Bach prelude, their older siblings would be in the process of becoming their only role models through the glorification of drugging up their bodies to a state of numbness. To a seventh grader drugs were cool and dangerous and banned, and because of that very banning, made all the more enticing. Sometimes the difference between addiction and a habit was just the timing of when you could first rebel against your parents. Lucky for you, Bach was better than cocaine.   <br><br>
At the same time you grew up being bullied and you realized that you weren’t mean to other people. You were not yourself a bully. So why did they have to mistreat you like this? It was not because of their trauma. Bullied people do not bully people. Mean people bully people. Assholes bully people. Insecure people bully people. 
You realize that you have stopped talking and the angel is just peering at you. In your embarrassment, you run and hide yourself in the stalls of the bathroom as you used to do in order to read your archie comics in peace. You managed to run in such a way that the Angel could not give chase. So, adventurer, what do you do next? <br><br>
