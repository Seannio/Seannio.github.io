      <h2>Follow me to the library</h2>
      <p>You climb down from the hill you were on and take the angel into your city. Without much wandering around, you head straight to the library. As you make your way there, the angel is very quiet. You try to avoid as many people as possible because you’re unsure if anyone else can see her. As well, you might be in the middle of a mental breakdown, and so maybe making that too public would not be too smart. <br><br>

Your face nearly smashes into the giant oak doors of the small library. In fact, you have to laugh a little bit, with the few books that this place holds, you always wondered why they built such ridiculously large doors. A nice shoulder shove helps you push open the door and the angel gets her first glimpse into the dim library. The head librarian, a woman who must be older than dust itself, is buried in some paper work. There are a couple other patrons there, one sitting with the newspaper at a study desk and another checking out the latest John Grisham novel. Avoiding this triumvirate of bookworms, you go to the theater section and find a copy of Hamlet. Luckily this section is well stocked, so you pull the first copy you find with no problem. The angel takes a quick glance at the title and then back at you waiting to see what you’re intentions are.<br><br>

“See angel, we humans also have our share of existential introspection while on earth. Let me read you a summation made by someone long ago”<br><br>

“To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause—there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.”
<br><br>
“What do you think?”
