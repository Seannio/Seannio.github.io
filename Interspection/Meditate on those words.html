      <h2>Meditate on those words</h2>
      <p>Those words seem strange to you. Heaven is a paradise filled with the suffering of eternal bliss. Pleasure…what is in that word? There is a promise not of happiness, because pleasure can come wrapped in misery. You can tell that when pleasure ends and you are still seeking the object lost. It manifests itself despite the fact that every thought about it brings you deep pain. No, pleasure comes with a certain feeling. A desire. Pleasure is the desire and the promise of further pleasure, of further desire. Maybe that is why heaven is such an underwhelming sensation. If it was possible to attain pleasure forever, then the very desire would be quenched. And that is what is driving the pleasure in the first place. We people don’t even want to be happy or angry or miserable. We can stand all those emotions as they come, but pleasure can only exist when the desire for it exists, and as such, nothing will ever be enough. That is what the souls in heaven eventually discover. Their desire is never enough, even in its infinite satisfaction. <br><br>
This pondering has set you on the path of meditation now. You must understand what is at the root of this pleasure and desire. Why does it hurt to attain the thing that makes us the happiest? You know, from your studies growing up that there was a famous French Philosopher, Renee Descartes, that meditated as the focal point of his philosophy. You also know that the central part of Buddhist religion is meditating on the feeling of desire, but you don’t know much about how to do that. So what shall you dive into traveler?
