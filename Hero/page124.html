      <h2>Stay True to Good Magic</h2>
      <p>Alright, so what if life has been a little dull up until now? At least you have a strong moral sense inside of your heart and you know that no amount of knowledge is worth your soul. If it ever came down to a real life choice between being your cringe 13 year old self, but end up with the same moral beliefs, or to gain knowledge in the style of doctor Faustus you would wipe Christopher Marlowe from the face of the earth in an instant. Now that you have a chance to really consider things, and that you realize that the angle truly is gone, you know why she chose you. This goodness, no matter what path you and up taking in life is going to follow you wherever you go. Yeah, skills they come and go. People enter your life and just as quickly they leave. The laughter of a thousand friend of the past will fall silent to a single cackle in the present, that is how worthy it’ll be for you to make those around you happy. You are a helpful person. Experience is a worthwhile endeavor, but what is the worth of endless experiences and skills if you are not making the world a better place at the same time. 
 <br><br>

Thus, there is no doubt on your mind at all. The goal is to be good. The goal is to be a hero for anyone and everyone who might need it. The problem then is how you want your training to come about. If you’d like to go off and join a master in the field to become their apprentice, then by all means, go off and seek our a master. Or if you’d rather try and figure things out on your own, then that is fair too. A lot of success comes from trying things out on your own too. No Shame there. So what say you hero? Which way will our adventure unfold?
