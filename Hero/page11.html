      <h2>You blink and look up</h2>
      <p>Dr. Freud peers at you from his chair, fascinated. "I have often encountered such dreams in my studies of the unconscious. People have visions from celestial beings all the time, its a matter of castration see." He pauses his thought to bring a large, clear jug of water to his pursed lips. The water rushes down his chin in small streams; he is clearly taking in way too much water for his system, yet, Freud doesn't stop for a second, making direct eye contact with you while downing the entire pitcher like a frat boy goaded on by a guy named Mark. He puts the jar down abruptly. "aaaa, refreshing" he says with a heavy German accent. Suddenly, there's a knock at the door. </p>
