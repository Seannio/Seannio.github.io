      <h2>Expanding skills with the bow</h2>
      <p>Now that you know your destiny is to do a hero does, you’re off to go learn all the possible skills of a bow at the nearby training camp. When you get there, you are completely ignored as far too many people have things to do to keep the camp operating smoothly. After crossing the threshold you see a small smithing hut. The clanks echoing from there ensure you that the production line of instruments for you to destroy later is running smoothly. You turn a little bit and you see a few soldiers running in the middle of the pitch. Others are wrestling with each other and having a sweet merry time of it. You spot a couple of huts back to back, probably for storage purposes. An old wizard looking man strolls solemnly observing the general state of things. Your eyes meet for a second and you sense that he has already figured you out before moving on to the next point of interest. <br><br>
        
Passing quickly by you, there is a short slim type fella whose sweater sleeves are far too big for his small frame. “Zcuse me, but you can’t just stand here, either join up or leave, but we can’t be wasting no space for loitering” He says as he zooms by without stopping. Turning your face to him, you see him dart into one of the unrecognizable buildings. <br><br>
Slowly, your feet approach the first hut and you see a sign on its small door explaining the different levels of feathers available at this training camp:<br><br>

White Feather
6 meters 12 hits<br><br>
Black Feather
10 meters 12 hits<br><br><br><br>
Blue Feather
14 meters 12 hits<br><br>
Red Feather 
18 meters 12 hits<br><br>
Gold Feather 
20 meters 12 hits<br><br><br><br>

The words on the page excite you and you think that it might be fun to read up about this world inside…then again, the grunts of men frolicking and sweating call to you too, so you can be sure that your physical form is up to standard. Which will in be oh hero? <br><br>
