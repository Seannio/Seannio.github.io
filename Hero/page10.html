      <h2>The Bow</h2>
      <p>The Bow has been a staple of warfare dating back to a time that doesn't use numbers for dating purposes so you know its older than the people grandma remembers as her parents. As such, mastery over the Bow takes years of rigorous training to harness precision accuracy and strength out of the naive fool that dare attempt such feats of war. Tell me traveler, how shall you approach your own feeble attempt at mastering the Bow?</p>
