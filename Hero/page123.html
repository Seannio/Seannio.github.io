      <h2>Attempt Your Own Magic</h2>
      <p>We live in the age of information don’t we? This is supposedly the time where you can reinvent yourself like no other period in human history. IF tomorrow your dad calls you up and mentions that he would love for you to be a lawyer, well within five years you could have your own practice attending online school and watching enough videos. It seems like that is the way to be a self-starter. Watch a video, set up a small shop, and watch it grow. Will you give in to the vice of the city? Not necessarily. Why not stay in a rural setting, you’ll be in a smaller pond but you’ll also be a much larger fish. Besides, who likes to swim anyway?  <br><br>
Exactly, the possibilities are endless and the advantages available at your finger tips are unlike anything that the greatest thinker of all time could have imagined. So why bother to learn magic in a institution which would feel as ridiculous as Hogwarts? J.K. Rowling crapped on her own lineage far more than you ever could. Besides, if you had a chance to write a fantasy series at the same time as hers, surely you would have come up with something less racist than naming the only Asian character in the series Cho Chang. The other end, the end of Sauron and Gandalf seems cool at first sight…except that the master of the Silmarillion forgot to add any significant women to his entire series. He would literally rather have a resurrected magician than a woman who might be central to the plot of a story.  <br><br>
Congratulations then! You are standing on the shoulders of the crumbling magic of the British empire. The old creators are flawed, and while a lot of our constructed imagination owes them a nod, it is time to break out on your own.  <br><br>
It is here, in the middle of this train of thought, that you realize that the angel is truly gone. Her role was just to set off your adventure, and now you are on it. What is stopping you from going to the darker parts of magic and rewriting the history of what wizardry can be? What better honor to your teachers of old than to make the present time a truly horrific place to exist. Show them your years of schooling and dullness taught you that anyone can inflict pain on others, all they need is the power to do so. Embrace the dark magic within the world and become the anti-hero of your own story.  <br><br>
Then again, maybe you could do it better yourself. The whole ‘teaching’ thing has had people complaining since Socrates, so maybe now, when everything is so close to reaching its perfected state, you yourself could be the resolution that pedagogy has been looking for. Perhaps by understanding magic itself and staring into the face of the mystical you will unlock what so many of our beloved teachers have attempted to impart on their droves of students.  <br><br>
The choice is fair. When breaking out on your own, if you then stray back to the basic path, if we dream together here a magical universe exactly like all the others that have been attempted then we might as well end out journey now. I will not waste out time with the tried and true tropes. Either embrace the darkness so we can explore the world of evil enchantments together or look at the field of magic itself and try to understand what makes it work. Harness that power and let’s push the field together.
