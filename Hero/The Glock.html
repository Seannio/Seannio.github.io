      <h2>The Glock</h2>
      <p>You turn your head to see if there is anything here that might save you from being torn in half by the speed of Freud. In your maneuverings you spot a Glock sitting on the counter between you. Without a second thought your hand grabs it and cocks it back. Freud stops for a second to stare at the black barrel pointed at his chest. <br><br>
“You really think you can kill me boy?” Freud spits out as he swallows the last of the water he had been drinking. “Try it, I dare you.”<br><br>
His confidence courses through you a little bit. Does he not realize you are aiming the whole barrel at him? I mean the man cannot possibly think he can beat you now? He is no athlete and at best he is a glorified porn scene creator. <br><br>
“Well boy? Are you going to shoot me or what?”<br><br>
Freud’s taunting seems ominous and the pounding at the door is getting stronger. Your thoughts are getting jumbled. As your hands shake with anxiety and stress Freud starts to smile<br><br>
“That’s right boy, you had nothing. You can’t ever defeat me. You can’t pull that trigger anymore than you can maintain your thoughts of sexual impurity from making you a chronic masturbator…or do you forget your mother’s funeral?”<br><br><br><br>
You close your eyes tightly to force out the image he was trying to elicit. <br><br>
“Yes. Let it out now boy. Let it out all over this room. Maybe then your Father will remember your name”<br><br>
BAM<br><br>
You open your eyes slowly. Your whole body is trembling in fear. The gun feels hot and your arms are tense. There is too much blood pumping through you. The knocking continues as you raise your head to see the damage. <br><br>
Yet there he is. Smiling. <br><br>
“Boy…my boy…You can’t kill an Austrian with a Glock, everyone knows that”<br><br>
There is a hole in the middle of his chest, and yet he remains standing.<br><br>
“This is going to be a bit of a bother” He says pointing at his new chest cavity. “But it is a start, You have shown that you are willing to take the first step in healing. You let out your energy. Now you are ready to feel. So tell me boy, what emotion are you going to feel?”
