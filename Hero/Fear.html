      <h2>Fear</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>Fear is peculiar. In a situation such as the one you were just in, fear, or adrenaline, were important for survival. But now you’re not so sure. <br><br>
You notice around you that the pounding had stopped. You look Freud in the eyes and he seems genuine in his care now. His face is pleading that you do as he suggested. So you start with a memory. <br><br>
You remember your college years. How many times you vomited out of the stress and fears about each assignments. How resilient you body was then. Oh! To be able to go into all hours of the night because you knew that no matter what you did to your system, it would recover. You’ve had enough hangovers and wild nights to remember that whatever you did, it would also pass into a faded memory. Something someone might bring up, and bring feelings to your chest, but nothing would penetrate your consciousness like early fear did. Another round of beer pong, another shot, another casual unprotected hookup, all of it blended together. Nothing had killed you. Not all of those Ex lovers that promised they would. Not any of the people that clearly did not enjoy you. Their eyes still cut scathingly, but you’ve learned to make a throne out of their annoyance. It is as though you’re the thing that sits upon their brow and makes them scowl at you so. <br><br>
But now things are different. You started having the nightmares people talk about. You recall for a moment the first time your parents caught you masturbating, and how horrified you had been at the shift in your relationship. That lead to the inescapability dreams. The ones where you were running away from something, and you could never quite get away. You were a bad person, and you have yet to reconcile with that fact. <br><br>
Even that dream was fine for a while. In running away and being chased, at least you knew the game. Horrible thing chases, you run. That’s it. But the dream that manifested from that one was worse. Suddenly you were in a hallway that reminded you of the cramped halls of your middle school. Sweaty, anxious halls that caved in as you walked through. And the thing you used to be running away from? That was no longer behind you. In fact, it was no longer horrible, but this precious promise of the future and of good life. The solace of having found something and someone that could accept you and that in that future, everything that you were was reconciled happily with what you are. Yet that thing stood in a warm glow, just a little too far from you. So you start running though the musky hallways and the darkness of the past. The tears in your eyes expressing the fact that your inhibition is no longer with you. The warmth of that glow is something you desire. And yet, as you run, it escapes you. You fail to reach it. You know what it feels like, and it is not yours. <br><br><br><br>
Every time you wake up from that that same fear carries over into the day. What if you can never attain it? What if it is never enough again?<br><br>
You snap out of that memory to realize you have been speaking this whole time, and Freud heard it all.<br><br>
Disappointment is what leads his nose across your vision back and forth denying what you just said. <br><br>
“No, no” He spits. “That is fear, but that sounds more like what your College roommate fears once he stops drinking and realizes he needs to live another long 60 years with his choices. No. These aren’t your fears. So Tell me Patient R, what do you fear?”<br><br>
