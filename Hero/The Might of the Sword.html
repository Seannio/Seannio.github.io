      <h2>The Might of the Sword</h2>
      <p>To be a hero, you will require many hours of training. But you have already taken the most important step. The sword as your choice will mean a lifetime of honing your craft. There will be no difference between you and the sword, and when you’re without it, your arm will feel incomplete. Nothing about this will be easy. You expect hundreds of hours sweating and grunting about in training fields. There will be embarrassment and frustration. But someday, after you have acquired enough skill to lift your head up from the shame of your inexperience, you hope to catch the eye of the King. <br><br>
  You sign yourself up for basic training and eagerly await the beginning of boot camp. The other scramps around you don’t look nearly as determined as you. Actually, now that you think about it, why are you even here? I mean, yes, this was the only place you could afford but maybe you don’t need this type of training. There are plenty of woods in the area and plenty of people that need help. Maybe you should go out and get some of those bark smarts people have always been talking about. Hell yeah! You’ll be a real Robin Hood. They will sing songs of your renown better than they ever did for him. Yes, one day you hope that a bunch of people sit in a classroom bored out of their minds as an insecure professor tries to make an academic career out of studying songs that the bards pen of your greatness. But will you ever care about them? The students maybe, nobody deserves that fate. But the professor will just have been sucking the life out of your great adventures while you were living it up. He deserves no mercy. There will be no shriveled academics when you rule. Nobody to correct you. The only rules will be written with the flexing of your wrist onto the blood of those you vanquish. <br><br>
So tell me adventurer will you stay in the training ground and seek out the glory at this Year’s King’s tournament, or will you march out on your own, and create an envied life of legend?
