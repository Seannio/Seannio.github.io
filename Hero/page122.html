      <h2>The King’s regiment</h2>
      <p>Since you already have some basic skills with the bow, you decide to enlist with the King’s own regiment. This is a crew of the finest bowmen in the kingdom, and you have no doubt that even a few months with them would have you in top shape and ready to be the mightiest hero in history! You sprint down the hill leaving the angel behind but knowing well that her blessing is with you. 
        <br><br>
Being a little disoriented after the whole business of being blessed, you have a hard time getting to the regimental recruitment grounds. You end up at the training grounds where a short man with a green sweater whose sleeves are too big for him informs you that the marshaling grounds are on the other side of their west wall. Climbing the wall itself is easy, what you miscalculate however, is where you needed to land, and instead of making it to the King’s regiment recruitment hut, you fall through a weak point in one of the thatched roofs. Embarrassed, and a little winded you scurry behind a column in the corner so that nobody sees you. 
<br><br>
Alerted by the sound of your tumbling frame crashing into their section, two guards rush in. You overhear them speak as they clean up the rotten wood boards off the ground. 
<br><br>
“We get all types of crazies coming and going this close to the tournament”
<br><br>
“Yeah, it’s like people recognize that there is a deadline and suddenly go recklessly headstrong into something without thinking about it. Almost seems like trying at something that might change your situation in life, even if you have no experience, is better than staying who you are”
<br><br>
“Jeez, you’re a bit of a downer this morning aren’t you?”
<br><br>
“I guess the Golden Arrow tournament always brings it out of me. I tried to be a part of the King’s bowmen years ago, and every time I see fresh faces join up it reminds me of my terrible failures. Not that I need that anyway. My husband left home and if I got fired today I would be destitute”
<br><br>
“I feel that, things are looking grim all over. I have no idea how I’m going to  be able to keep maintaining my family if my body is damaged here guarding the place. It really seems like there is more and more crime each day. I wonder if this whole kingdom isn’t on the edge of collapse as it is.”
<br><br>
The scuffling of feet let’s you know that a third person has also entered this hall. 
<br><br>
“Hurry Hurry! Clean this up! The King is passing by on his pre-tournament inspection and he expects this place to be In tip top shape!” Shouts a new shrill voice. 
<br><br>
“Yeah yeah, we are going Mentio, no need to get uppity. Say, what’s that you’ve got there?”
You hear a bit of a scuffle. 
<br><br>
“Give that back” Shouts the Shrill voice. “That is the official list of entrants to the tourney!” 
“Oh Sick Sir Onverslaanbaar is going to be in this one. He has some mighty arms”
“Oh I hear the king coming c’mon let’s hurry this way so that we aren’t spotted” spits the shrill voice again and you hear the three bodies exit to your right. 
<br><br>
You peak your head out a little and the coast seems clear. Now you’ve got a real choice. You could attempt to follow Mentio and the two guard to see if you can intimidate them into giving you and edge in the tournament. On the other hand, you could head left and attempt to get noticed by the King. Maybe his good graces before the tournament would be the boost you need to ensure victory.
