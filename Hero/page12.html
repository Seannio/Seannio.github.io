      <h2>That's Right the Bastard has had enough fun</h2>
      <p>Despite the now frantic knocking that is occuring at the door, you know what your real destiny was all along. The Angel was only a farse. You were meant to Kill Sigmund Freud. You leap out of the couch all cool like. Freud has already smashed the jar of water and is now slicing at you with deadly speed. With every violent jerk his body seems to go in two directions. You'll never out run him in this cramped office. But you might be able to kill him if you think quickly. </p>
