      <h2>Mastery Over Magic</h2>
      <p>Smart. Studying the arcane will push you beyond the limitations that exist with those simple heroes that chose weapons. Honestly what is so fanciful about some guy with a sword running around hacking and slashing, blood all over himself? Nah that’s not the lifestyle for you. You were always meant for something less gruesome. Even in school you had always tended to excel more in the books than in the field. There had been that incident with Sul, a kid a year younger than you but with the ferocity of a wild beast. You had once seen him screech and attack another fellow classmate and the blood produced in that pummeling was enough to steer you away from such violence. <br><br>
Yes your schooling did have those few moments of vivid recollection but otherwise there was not a lot to say about that. School was inherently boring in its set up. Day in and day out you sit long enough in a room in order to be let free from that room. Everyone stares forward, with one person going on about their interests…looking back it reminds you more of the bad dating experiences you’ve had while trying to meet people than anything remotely relating to intellectual engagement. The tasks were not hard, not challenging enough and so they remained in your mind as a thousand menial motions that you did long enough to be able to say that you did. The reward came at the end and not in the thing itself.<br><br>
“Well I have to get my assignments done so that I can pass so that I can graduate so that I can get a job..” <br><br>
And so on ad infinitum. But where was the choice in that? That wasn’t really you and it would never be. The angel saw something in you. It knew that you had magic inside of you, ready to be harnessed. Next you needed to find someway to train that magic so that you could succeed. That should be the real goal of any education, you thought, to be able to push the latent skills within people to the next level. Such style of teaching would be better than having everyone acquire the same skills. Then again maybe that was a little too deterministic. Does everyone have certain abilities within themselves? Surely the fact that that angel came around meant something…as if the fact that you have inherent magic means the rest of the world does too? Then you wonder why fate chose you? Why is it necessary that Destiny speaks to some of us but not to others? Now you’re understanding. Fate spoke to you because she knew you were a hero. You have to stand up for those who do not have Destiny’s blessing within themselves. But first you have to be able to find your own. You must learn what is involved in magic and what part you need to play within the world of the arcane. This will be a long learning process but you have a sense of inspiration about you.  <br><br>
By that point in your own thinking, the angel has long left and you are alone standing atop a mountain. Anxiety sets in as you’re not entirely sure you are up for this intellectual task. Even if you were better at books that was because you were lousy in the field. You were never particularly bright, but not dull either. Everyone around you looks more put together than you. They are all up for the task of a practiced intellectual. They know what is involved in fighting for goodness. They know what the world needs and are giving it their all everyday to make sure that comes about. Heck, you’ve done practically nothing until today. And yet the Angel chose you. Why not renounce this calling? Nah too soon for that. Destiny, fate, an angel, now magic…you are the stuff of myths. And you won’t over use it right? Fate chose you because you will be good. There was a reason. The world is not random. That must be true. Things worked out for you because you are good and other people are bad…but…even if they are you are meant to help those people out. You are meant to make their lives better through your own goodness. Then they too would be able to help out those with more evil intentions. You suppose while you are reflecting on the years of your schooling in all of this there were a few teachers that stood out to you over the years. These were not merely barking orders but they had a level of freedom in their teaching. This freedom reflected their personalities and so, they were able to impact you with that. Some lessons were more meaningful than others. For example there was one teacher who gave you no parameters for an assignment other than to “make it memorable”. What better mantra to live under as your life transitions again? You were off on your journey, and you were going to make it memorable. So hero, how will you begin your studies into the arcane to make this path truly memorable?
