      <h2>Hi there! You've reached AN end</h2>
      <p>But this doesn't have to be THE end. WE believe this to be a true chose your own adventure, because the rest of this path is entirely up to you. Much like all the previous paths were created by players with persistent imaginations, now it is your turn to carve out your own solution to the mess you're in. Email me at:trailforge@AOL.com. Tell me the node that you are in, as well as how you would like to go forward and I will path it put for you. Remember that your only real win condition in the entire game is to keep me entertained. Do that, and you will go far. Fail to do so, however, and your story will meet an unfortunate end. </p>

      <p> Good Luck, and Thank God for Sean Morris <p>
